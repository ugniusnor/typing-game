# Typing game made with react

## Thanks for checking this project! 

It was a very simple excersice to kill a few hours over the weekend, while improving my React development skills.
Idea for this game came from scrimba platform while watching React courses.

## My goal
My goal for this mini project was to start learning and using React Testing Library, which I did and hope to improve on and use it more in my future projects.
